 2) Performing complete EDA in detail to explore the insights of data and writing detailed observations of each analysis.
**Phase 4**
1) Writing the complete Machine learning code to make predictions of votes and gross collection. Use appropriate models on their label basis.  Making 2 different predictions: vote and gross collection.
2) Applying all the best techniques of scaling, and hyperparameter tuning, and avoiding underfitting or overfitting (bias/variance)
3) At the end saving the best model and conveying on which basis the model has been choosen
